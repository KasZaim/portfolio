                <h3>General notes on the legal basis of data processing on this website</h3>
                <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG.

Data processing may also take place based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The respective legal bases on which processing is based are informed in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
            
                <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
                <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external entities. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external entities. We only pass on personal data to external entities if this is necessary as part of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>
            
                <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
                <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
            
                <h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
                <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR IF THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
                <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
            
                <h3>Right to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3>
                <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, especially in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
            
                <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
                <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
            
                <h3>Information, correction, and deletion</h3>
                <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of these data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
            
                <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                    <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                    <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                    <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – apart from their storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
